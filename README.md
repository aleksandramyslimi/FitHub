Project Details
Project Title: Fithub Fitness App

Problem Statement:
The need for a simple, accessible, and user-friendly fitness tracking application. Many users struggle with tracking their fitness activities and progress in an organized manner. Existing fitness apps may be too complicated or not tailored for beginners, leading to underutilization of features. This project aims to fill this gap by offering a basic, straightforward, and efficient app for users to log and track their workouts.

Solution Proposed:
We propose developing a simple Python-based fitness app called Fithub, where users can register, log their workouts (including the type of exercise and duration), and view their workout history. The app will be text-based and store user data in plain text files for simplicity. As the project progresses, more features such as graphical user interfaces and mobile app support may be added.

Project Scope:
Aim: To develop a basic fitness tracking app that allows users to log their workouts and view their history.
Main Objectives:
Enable user registration and authentication (login system).
Allow users to log different types of workouts (e.g., running, yoga).
Provide a view of the userâ€™s workout history.
Store data in text files (users.txt and workouts.txt).
Test the app for functionality and ensure data persistence.

Application Description:
Fithub is a Python-based console application aimed at individuals who want a simple solution to track their fitness activities. It will allow users to:

Register for a new account or log in to an existing one.
Log various types of workouts, including duration and type (e.g., "Running" for 30 minutes).
View a list of past workouts to help monitor progress.
The app is designed for individuals who are new to fitness tracking and want an easy way to stay on top of their workouts without being overwhelmed by unnecessary features. In future phases, the app could expand to support features such as progress graphs, integration with external devices, and a web or mobile interface.
